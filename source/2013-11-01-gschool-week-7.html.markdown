Week 7
======

### What did you learn through CloneWars?

I learned how to use a scraper and I implemented some db interaction with Sequel in a sqlite3 database. I don't think I really learned anything new but I finally got a chance to practice using those things. I already had exposure to most of these things through tutorials, Ideabox, and the reading group. Putting them all together was a different story and looking back, it was really good for us as students to do so.

I don't think there are any confusing parts in our working master branch. We did TDD the entire way through and that let me have a pretty solid understanding of all the steps we good. At the very end we tried to implement authentication. It sort of worked. But we didn't follow TDD there, we just copied some crap we found off the internet. It created an error that I had no idea how to debug. I would have given it a much longer look but we were at the end of the time limit and we were satisfied with our experience up to that point.

I feel ...okay about using feature/acceptance tests. I need more practice because it still takes me some time to figure out if I am doing what I should be doing. I have to put more effort into thinking about what a feature/acceptance test needs to do. I'm pretty sure we mixed our acceptance tests together with an integration test (the controller test from ideabox)... so there was still some confusion there.

If I had another week I would have went into the direction of revamping the site. Our progress got us to pretty much remaking the site in rails but we hadn't made any changes to make it better and we didn't involve any features like editable objects that we could place on the admin page. We also didn't have any forms or foreign key use in our database.

Working in a three person group was challenging for me. I am much more used to a one on one interaction. I find it harder to focus on the needs of one member when there is another member present. It was hard enough learning to focus on a partner when there are just two people and you have to get through a project. Add in another person and I start feeling more conflicted between things I think we should focus on, and trying to take in what the other members think we should focus on, all while trying to keep everyone on the same page.
