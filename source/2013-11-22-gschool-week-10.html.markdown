# Retrospective...

So I've missed out on the last two Fridays.
The first one I went to see my girlfriend.
The second one I was in SF interviewing with a startup at Y-Combinator.

### How I am feeling about gSchool right now.

I wasn't at the code retreat. It sounds like it was fun.

I wanted to spend some of my free time learning how to write tests in rspec and becoming more familiar with Rails Apps since I do as much on the backend during Dinner Dash. I found it hard to separate the tasks required for us to complete Dinner Dash. I think it would have helped to have had a more solid direction that we wanted to head towards in the beginning. There was a lot of butting of heads and disagreement but we got it mostly done. Also, I flew to another state... pretty much twice during this project so that didn't help either.

This week was focus week, so it was more relaxing than before. We spent our time learning JavaScript. It was nice the be exposed to some of the cool things it can do. I will definitely want to spend more time putting out projects involving JavaScript and the many libraries out there.
I definitely want to spend more time using JavaScript in my future projects. In fact, I was going to go snowboarding this weekend but I might have to push that aside so I can spend some more time finishing the things I started this week that would help me learn rspec better and apply javascript to a project.

I think I understand javascript well enough to be able to code and debug it but there is definitely a lot more exposure needed for me to really feel like I have the sense that I know what I'm doing. 
I think going home for break will be really good for all of us.

Another thing on my mind right now is what will be happening after gSchool. After the SF trip, my options for post gSchool work has changed and it is a heavy burden on my mind. It's not the process that we'll be going through but more where I'll end up and how it might affect Liz and I.

I still don't feel too solid on testing... 

I subscribed to railscasts though so I think I'll be filling in my free time with that.

I'm pretty exhausted from this week even though it was more relaxing than before. I think it was all the traveling that threw me off.

This is a poorly written. I'm sorry.
