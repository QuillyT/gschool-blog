<h1>Week 1</h1>

<p>This week got a little crazy. I went home past 11pm once. The rest of the time I was at Galvanize till at least 10 and if I left early I went home and programmed until close to midnight. Event Reporter has been... intense to say the least. The difficulty this week was managing my time between helping people and writing my own code. I ran out of time and decided to take the non-TDD route which was a little less tedious but I am not as confident in that code as I am in the classes that I did write tests for.</p>

<p>After the code review I felt extremely confident. I pretty much had the rest of the day to myself and after learning about tmux from Nathaniel (thanks buddy, it's amazing!) and using iterm and ctrlP and whatever else we got from him, I was able to take my working project, hunker down, and bust out a much muuuuch better EventReporter class. All my methods do one or two jobs at most. The second job is usually just to print something ... most of the time.</p>

<p>I'm still missing a bunch of tests but I believe I made my program in a way that allows for fairly easy testing. Since most methods only do one job it shouldn't be too hard to develop tests for them.</p>

<p>Looking back, when I was starting the EventReporter project, in my mind, I was definitely making things harder than I had to. I was also just taking too long to figure out what I needed. It eventually reached the night before stuff was "due" and I started from scratch and wrote a program that just worked. Luckily this project was simple enough for me to be able to do that. It was super ugly though. However, since I had laid everything out I was able to piece it apart into different classes which helped me refactor it into the code that I'm relatively proud of now. It's not great, but it is a huge improvement on what I had before.</p>

<h2>Expectations</h2>

<p>So I'm expecting everything to ramp up in terms of difficulty. There are still people that probably need to get caught up so maybe this expectation will have to wait for another couple weeks but the "aha!" moment should be upon most people pretty soon.</p>

<h2>Worries</h2>
<p>Still not worried about much. My confidence in gschool is still there as Jeff, Katrina, Frank, and Jorge are still teaching us. I guess if I had to be worried about something, it would be that I am making the most of my time with the instructors. I guess I should ask them for other ways that I can take advantage of their time.</p>
