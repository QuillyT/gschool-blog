<h1>Week 4</h1>

<p>I have my lightning talk today. This will be a short retrospective. This last week was really fun. Got to pair with another classmate and we both had a HUGE interested in making ultimate tic tac toe in the extra time that we had. Processing is pretty fun...</p>

<p>p.s. Louisa is KILLIN it!</p>

<h2>Expectations</h2>

<p>I was busy prepping for my lightning talk all week so it was still super busy. I think I was supposed to get my rest but I definitely didn't. I saw what we'll be working with next week and it looks fun. We're finally going to be doing some web stuff. It's really cool watching the other people in the class come up with stuff.</p>

<h2>Worries</h2>

<p>I think I still need to work on my time management. No, I definitely do. Yay gSchool! okthxbye.</p>
