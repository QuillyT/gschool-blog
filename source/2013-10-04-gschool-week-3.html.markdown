<h1>Week 3</h1>

<p>Pairing for over two weeks was great. I was working with Nathaniel and we both understood all programming concepts pretty well. Pair programmed through about 97% of the project. The other 3% was us splitting up some of the tedious repetitive work. I definitely felt more productie with Nathaniel because... that guy is on speed or something. His brain works too fast for me and watching his typing from my screen makes me feel bad for slowing our pair down, haha. So the fact that he was able to think through things faster than me made it kind of hard for me to catch on immediately. Most of the time I would just trust him and figure things out later when I had some free time and it always ended up that we had been doing the correct logic so that was cool. I guess I need to work on understanding things faster. Still, it was a treat to work with someone like Nathaniel. We paired over tmux and it was really cool and our productivity was defintiely higher than if I had done the project alone. Pairing was very interesting because we would often catch small mistakes as the other person was typing and it really saved us a lot of debugging time.</p>

<p>I hate to say this but if I am going to be honest, I feel like I have mastered less than I expected in 4 weeks. I don't blame anyone for it and the lack of mastering stuff was made up for by the interactions and practice of working with my fellow classmates who were having trouble understanding things that I already had down. My first priority was to finisht he project at hand but since my group had made a good deal of progress during class I was usually able to spent time with other classmates in the evenings. So on one hand, while it would have been nice to read some of the many books that I keep hearing about, and writing down in my book list, I do feel like I gained a lot from teaching and going through the basic concepts of ruby. Not only was I able to solidify my understandings but it's also a great feeling to see my friends pick up the ideas that I'm trying to teach them. Also I have been meaning to try out Go but recently I haven't had time for that. Maybe during focus week!</p>

<h2>Expectations</h2>

<p>I believe my skills will be well beyond where thay are now in 5 months. I'm definitely learning new things everyday and I can't wait to use them all at some point. I expect my testing skills to be automatic and my thought process to be thorough and creative. I expect to be able to look back at old projects and to be able to refactor them all easily for better performance and readability. I expect to be able to type faster and navigate through files with vim and through the terminal. I also expect to be extremely familiar with git. I also expect to be a better communicator. I hope to have the time and opportunity to continue helping classmates who aren't in my project group.</p>

<p>As of right now my first choice would be to work for Pivotal Labs. They sound like a solid company where I can continue to grow and learn from other people. I would hope to be able to work for them in New York or SF. Boulder would be a close third option. I haven't really looked into other companies as thoroughly but so far that is my top choice. I definitely want to end up at a place where I can continue to work on projects and around people who will push me to a higher standard and help add to my creativity and knowledge.</p>

<p>I also expect to be rippppped in 5 months. Just being here in Denver is a workout... attempting to go to the gym every morning better get me cut!</p>

<h3>Learning Strategies</h3>

<p>Just talking to the instructors as much as possible has been a great learning strategy. Surrounding my self with people who know more than me has been the best thing for me so far. If I had come from a non-programming background I think the best thing at this point would have been just experimenting and trying everything out in irb. Actually using techniques and practicing them is really what I think would improve my confidence as a developer.</p>

<h2>Worries</h2>

<p>Still not worried about anything for myself. I guess if I had to say something it would be that I'm worried that I don't have enough time to work with classmates who need help. I hate to leave peopel hanging.</p>
