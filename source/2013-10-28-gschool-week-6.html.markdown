Week 6
======

So we turned in IdeaBox. I'm really disappointed in my performance on it but I'm was happy with the way I did the project. I barely got through a single extension due to restarting the project so many times. I wanted to learn the "right" way to do it (via TDD).

So I did the original tutorial first, then I went through and tried to use TDD to do the entire thing myself, and then I did the TDD tutorial assuming I had started my project the wrong way (unit level tests before acceptance/feature testing) however the TDD tutorial was done pretty similarly but I was afraid to mix and match what I had with the tutorial thinking it might confuse me.

Another thing I started doing was following my mentors suggestion of using an industry standard github work flow. I like how it works and it will make things easier for my mentor in the future when I want him to review changes that I've made to code.

I decided to make my deliverable for my reading group something that is actually useful so I am making a homepage for current gSchoolers. It will have the usual: Calendar, Daily Outline, Groupbuzz link and it will also have a suggested sites link.

The suggested sites link is essentially going to be a redo of IdeaBox, just instead of ideas, it will be links with tags that are easily searchable and taggable. A little... redemption for myself from the last project I guess. I'm actually really excited to work on it.

Friday was really cool. Pair programming exercises and challenges are really fun!

Hanging out at Simon's for a little gSchool Halloween get together was really cool too! I went ot a Gareth Emery concert with Jonah, my sister and Katrina's roommate Emilia. Also fun!

Oh yeah, we started this thing called Study Hall. It's like... a 1-2 hour period of time where we can get together with out classmates and help each other on things we don't understand or went over in class and didn't pickup as quickly as we wanted to. It's like a little way for us to digest information together in our own ways on our own time. I really wish we had started this weeks ago. It definitely would have benefited everyone.


Expectations
------------

This week is going to be hard. I don't think I'll have much time to work on personal projects and it would distract me from my group work to work on things other than the project at hand... Unless I am really good about prioritizing and sticking to times that I have alotted myself for certain things. I say this week is going to be hard because we'll be working in groups of three and we're barely getting used to working in groups of two. Bring it on!

The problems I may have had before are kind of out of my mind now. This week I did less helping than previous weeks so with more time to myself I feel like I had more opportunities for personal enrichment. Jeff's tip on setting a schedule and following it was key. Now I just need to follow it!

Worries
-------

No worries really. I'm feeling pretty good about everything right now. Maybe I'm a little worried about the progress of some of my fellow classmates but it's a lot better than previous weeks.
