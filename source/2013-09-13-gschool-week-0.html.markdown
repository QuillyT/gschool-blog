<h1>Week 0</h1>

<p>It's been fun so far. People here are nice. I am excited for what is down the road.</p>

<h2>Expectations</h2>

<p>I am expecting for our tasks to be relatively easy for me for a little longer. But only a little. I'm thinking within 2 or 3 weeks I'll have to slow down a bit and take my time learning the new things that we get involved in.</p>

<h2>Worries</h2>
<p>I am not really worried about learning anything. I'm a little concerned about how the interactions will go when we have group work to do and how the differing levels of experience will affect the cohesion, efficiency, and ability of the group to get stuff out of everything.</p>
