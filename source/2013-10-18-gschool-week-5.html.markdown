Week 5
======

We started in IdeaBox. I am on my third try. On the first attempt, I went through the tutorial. It was easy enough but I did it when I was tired so I made a lot of mistakes. It was good to know that I could get through the errors messages though. I rarely had to rely on looking back at the tutorial to fix problems. The second attempt I wanted to do TDD but I started with all the unit tests and included things required in the extensions. I quickly realized this was not the way to go. Now after a week, I'm on my third try. I am going full TDD. It feels a lot better. There are a lot of things that I'm going through that make me feel a lot more comfortable with creating an app from scratch. I won't have much time to work on it this weekend but hopefully next week I will be able to focus a lot more of my energy on it.

This weekend, Liz is coming to visit. I can't wait ot pick her up from the airport. I'm a little vexed that we're not allowed to work on IdeaBox during the day today but that rule is there for a reason.



It snowed today. Snowboarding season has neared. I'm pretty excited about that.

Expectations
------------

The way I feel about gSchool has changed a bit since I arrived here. In the earlier days of class I felt that since I was further ahead that most students it was okay that I didn't receive as much attention from the instructors. I was helping a lot of other students out and that was giving me reinforcement of what I knew. However now that people are catching up, I would like to get a little more direction. I'm not really sure how to approach some things (TDD on a web app...capybara...etc). However I'm still confident I can figure these things out on my own, it's just a matter of time. It would be nice to just ask for an answer so I could move on but I think it's also really important that I'm able ot arrive at the answers myself. But then I wonder...if I'm not going ot take advantage of the instructors, what was the point of me coming here? I think the real problem lies within my personality. I should just feel more free to ask questions. Although a lot of the time I get the feeling that I shouldn't be bothering the instructors since they have things to do too (other projects, preparation for other classes, helping other students). Maybe it's just weird right now because of a transition period.

Also, I found that I had a really hard time figuring out how I wanted to do this project when I was at gSchool. It seems that I'm still more of a homebody and need some of my time alone to figure things out. It's going to be really interesting to see how my environment will affect my progress throughout the rest of this program.

Worries
-------

After writing this out and thinking through the situations I've gone through, I can step back and realize that I'm still confident in my abilities and what I will be getting out of my time here. Maybe I'm worried that I won't maximize it though...
